My Repos Repo
=============

This is my attempt at keeping a bunch of projects organized. I tend to end up
with files scattered everywhere and then having to manually update when I think
about it. With everything in this one repository I can simply update it all at
once and it makes re-downloading all this stuff on a new computer easy.

To use this repository, add the `--recursive` flag to your git clone line. For
example: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/inhies/repos`. If you've
already cloned this, `cd` in to its directory and run `git submodule update
--init`.

To update everything contained herin, run `git submodule update --recursive`
from the root directory of this repository.
